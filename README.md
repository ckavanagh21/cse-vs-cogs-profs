# cse-vs-cogs-profs
Small DS project to see if COGS professors are better than CSE professors

Based on the classes I've taken with the departments and the CAPE reviews that I've looked over, I had a theory that the professors in the CSE department were inferior to the professors in the COGS department. However, I've never actually had any real way to prove it. This notebook explores some statistical tests of the hypothesis, "Are COGS professors better than CSE professors based on CAPE Recommend Instructor rates?"

Results are located in the COGS vs. CSE Jupyter Notebook. I also analyzed the same with the math department in the COGS vs. Math Jupyter notebook.
